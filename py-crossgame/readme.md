## Installation

 - Install the required packages:

## Usage

1. Run `main.py`:


2. Use the arrow keys to move your turtle across the road while avoiding the cars.

3. Your turtle can only move forward or backward, but not left or right.

4. You have three lives, and if you get hit by a car three times, the game is over.

5. Once you successfully cross the road, you move on to the next level, where the cars move faster and there are more of them.

6. Customize the game settings in `config.py`.
